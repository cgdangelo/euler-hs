-- Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file 
-- containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into 
-- alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, 
-- multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name
-- score.

-- For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is
-- worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN
-- would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

-- What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
